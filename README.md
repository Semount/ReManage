# ReManage
My diploma project. Contains functionality for managing restaurant.

The whole idea was to give to three common types of employees their own stuff to do their job.

## Functionality list
- Waiter: create, edit, remove **orders**, can see graphic representation and create orders from it
- Chef: view and complete **orders**, can see detailed information about **dishes**
- Administrator: create and edit **dishes, products, employees and graphic representation**, can also see brief **statistics**.


## Installation

Simply clone this repository and run it. Then:
- You will need PSQL server running.
- On login screen, press the top left button
- On the bottom of the opened window enter **name** and **password** for PSQL admin user 
- Click on "Создать базу данных"
- Fill all fields for the connection
- Use it :)
